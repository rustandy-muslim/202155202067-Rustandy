              "'\\n\\nWho is Ir.Soekarno?\\n\\nPossibly the most frequently asked question by our foreign clients.\\n\\nThe reason is simple: Ir. Soekarno is the name of our founder and the one who started the company in 1993.\\n\\nBut to understand the origin and meaning of Ir. Soekarno, we need to go back in history to the year 1942.\\n\\nIn 1942, Indonesia was under Japanese occupation and the country was renamed as the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.\\n\\nThe Japanese authorities demanded that all Indonesian citizens adopt a Japanese name, and the Indonesian national hero Sukarno, who was then imprisoned by the Dutch, refused to do so.\\n\\nIn response, the Japanese authorities arrested Sukarno and gave him the Japanese name of Kusanagi Shusaku.\\n\\nAfter Indonesia gained its independence in 1945, Sukarno returned to his Indonesian name, but he also kept the Japanese name Kusanagi Shusaku as a reminder of his resistance against the Japanese occupation.\\n\\nOur founder Ir. Soekarno was born in 1965, and he chose the Japanese name Kusanagi Shusaku as his nickname, as a tribute to the Indonesian national hero Sukarno and his resistance against the Japanese occupation.\\n\\nHowever, in the Indonesian legal system, a person\\'s legal name is referred to as their \"nama resmi\" (official name) and their nickname is referred to as their \"nama sehari-sehari\" (day-to-day name).\\n\\nTherefore, Ir. Soekarno\\'s legal name is Ir. Kusnadi Ir. Kuswanto, and his nickname is Ir. Soekarno (Kusanagi Shusaku).\\n\\nWe hope this explanation helps our foreign clients to better understand the meaning and origin of Ir. Soekarno\\'s name!\\n\\nKusanagi Shusaku (Ir. Soekarno) was born in 1965 in Jakarta, Indonesia. He graduated from the Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB) with a degree in Mechanical Engineering in 1990.\\n\\nAfter completing his studies, Ir. Soekarno'"
